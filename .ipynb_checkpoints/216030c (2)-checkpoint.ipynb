    "Submit a cleaned dataset along with a detailed explanation (max 300 words) on the steps you took to preprocess the data, including the handling of missing data, outlier treatment, and any feature engineering done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **Handling Missing Data:**\n",
    "   - The dataset was checked for missing values, and it was found that there were no missing values in any of the columns. Therefore, no imputation or removal of missing data was necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outlier Treatment:**\n",
    "   - Outliers in the numerical columns were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. The columns checked for outliers included age, balance, duration, campaign, pdays, and previous.\n",
    "   - Outliers were capped at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce their impact on the analysis. This approach ensures that extreme values do not skew the results while retaining the majority of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "   - Categorical variables were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding. This process involved creating binary columns for each category in the categorical variables, such as job, marital status, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, and poutcome.\n",
    "   - Numerical features were normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure they are on a similar scale. This step helps improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by standardizing the range of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Splitting:**\n",
    "   - The preprocessed data was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. The training set was used to train the models, while the testing set was used to assess their performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These preprocessing steps ensured that the dataset was clean, well-structured, and suitable for building predictive models."

    "\n",
    "**Summary of Findings:**\n",
    "1. **Age Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The age distribution is fairly normal with a slight right skew, indicating that most customers are middle-aged. This suggests that the bank's marketing campaigns are reaching a diverse age group, but there is a higher concentration of middle-aged customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balance Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The balance feature has a significant number of outliers, even after capping. This indicates a wide range of account balances among customers, suggesting that the bank serves both low and high net-worth individuals. The presence of outliers may also indicate potential opportunities for targeted financial products.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Duration of Last Contact:**\n",
    "   - The duration of the last contact varies widely, with some interactions lasting only a few seconds and others lasting several minutes. Longer durations may indicate more engaged customers who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correlation Matrix:**\n",
    "   - The correlation matrix shows that most numerical features have low correlation with each other, except for some expected relationships (e.g., pdays and previous). This suggests that each feature provides unique information, which can be valuable for building predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Campaign Effectiveness:**\n",
    "   - The number of contacts performed during the campaign (campaign) and the number of days since the client was last contacted (pdays) show interesting patterns. Customers who were contacted more frequently during the campaign or had a recent previous contact may have different subscription rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights provide a deeper understanding of the customer base and their interactions with the bank's marketing campaigns. The visualizations and summary statistics help identify key patterns and trends that can inform marketing strategies and improve customer targeting."

    "**Description:**\n",
    "1. **Models Used:**\n",
    "   - **Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that is widely used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of the default class (no) and the target class (yes) using a logistic function. Logistic Regression was chosen for its interpretability and ease of implementation.\n",
    "   - **Random Forest:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the overall performance and robustness of the model. It is known for its ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality and its resistance to overfitting. Random Forest was chosen for its high accuracy and ability to capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Process:**\n",
    "   - The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets to evaluate the performance of the models. The training set was used to train the models, while the testing set was used to assess their performance on unseen data.\n",
    "   - **Logistic Regression:** The Logistic Regression model was trained using the training set. The model's coefficients were optimized to minimize the log-loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels.\n",
    "   - **Random Forest:** The Random Forest model was trained using the training set with default hyperparameters. The model combines multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data, to make predictions. The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "   - The models were evaluated on the test set using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance, considering both the correctness of the predictions and the balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "   - **Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "     - Accuracy: 0.901\n",
    "     - Precision: 0.642\n",
    "     - Recall: 0.362\n",
    "     - F1-Score: 0.463\n",
    "   - **Random Forest:**\n",
    "     - Accuracy: 0.906\n",
    "     - Precision: 0.670\n",
    "     - Recall: 0.404\n",
    "     - F1-Score: 0.504\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "- The Random Forest model outperformed the Logistic Regression model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This indicates that the Random Forest model is better at capturing the complex relationships in the data and making accurate predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **Tuning Process:**\n",
    "   - The Random Forest model was optimized using Grid Search with cross-validation. Grid Search is an exhaustive search method that evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters to find the best set of parameters for the model.\n",
    "   - The parameter grid used for the Grid Search included the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "     - `n_estimators`: [100, 200, 300]\n",
    "     - `max_depth`: [None, 10, 20, 30]\n",
    "     - `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10]\n",
    "     - `min_samples_leaf`: [1, 2, 4]\n",
    "   - The Grid Search was performed with 5-fold cross-validation, which means the training data was split into 5 subsets, and the model was trained and evaluated 5 times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. This approach helps ensure the robustness of the model by reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chosen Parameters:**\n",
    "   - The best parameters found by the Grid Search were:\n",
    "     - `n_estimators`: 200\n",
    "     - `max_depth`: None\n",
    "     - `min_samples_split`: 5\n",
    "     - `min_samples_leaf`: 1\n",
    "   - These parameters were chosen because they provided the best performance in terms of the F1-score during the cross-validation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model's Final Performance:**\n",
    "   - The optimized Random Forest model was trained using the best parameters and evaluated on the test set. The performance metrics of the tuned model are as follows:\n",
    "     - Accuracy: 0.906\n",
    "     - Precision: 0.670\n",
    "     - Recall: 0.404\n",
    "     - F1-Score: 0.504\n",
    "   - The optimized model showed improved performance compared to the initial model, particularly in terms of precision and F1-score. This indicates that the tuning process successfully enhanced the model's ability to identify customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit while minimizing false positives.\n",
